;;; Commentary:

;; A profiler for font-lock keywords.  This package measures time and
;; counts the number of times each part of a font-lock keyword is
;; used.  For matchers, it counts the total number and the number of
;; successful matches.
;;
;; The result is presented in table that can be sorted by count or
;; time.  The table can be expanded to include each part of the
;; font-lock keyword.
;;
;; In addition, this package can generate a log of all font-lock
;; events.  This can be used to verify font-lock implementations,
;; concretely, this is used for back-to-back tests of the real
;; font-lock engine and Font Lock Studio, an interactive debugger for
;; font-lock keywords.

;; Usage:
;;
;; Use the following functions:
;;
;; - `font-lock-profiler-buffer' -- Fontify the entire buffer and
;;   present the profiling result.
;;
;; - `font-lock-profiler-region' -- Fontify the region and present the
;;   profiling result.
;;
;; - `font-lock-profiler-start' -- Enable "live" profiling.  Do
;;   whatever you want to do measure (like editing or scrolling).  When
;;   done, run `font-lock-profiler-stop-and-report'.

;; The result buffer:
;;
;; Once the profiling has been performed, the reporter buffer,
;; `*FontLockProfiler*' is displayed.  It contains a list of all
;; font-lock keywords, the number of times they matched and the total
;; time that was spent running them.
;;
;; By pressing `x', the view is expanded into displaying the
;; corresponding information for each highlight rule, including
;; anchored highlights.

;; Additional features:
;;
;; - The variable `font-lock-profiler-remaining-matches', when set to
;;   an integer, the instrumented keywords will fake a match failure
;;   after this many matches.  This is useful, for example, when
;;   working with keywords where a search would never terminate
;;   (without this, Emacs would hang).

;; Other Font Lock Tools:
;;
;; This package is part of a suite of font-lock tools.  The other
;; tools in the suite are:
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Studio:
;;
;; Interactive debugger for font-lock keywords (Emacs syntax
;; highlighting rules).
;;
;; Font Lock Studio lets you *single-step* Font Lock keywords --
;; matchers, highlights, and anchored rules, so that you can see what
;; happens when a buffer is fontified.  You can set *breakpoints* on
;; or inside rules and *run* until one has been hit.  When inside a
;; rule, matches are *visualized* using a palette of background
;; colors.  The *explainer* can describe a rule in plain-text English.
;; Tight integration with *Edebug* allows you to step into Lisp
;; expressions that are part of the Font Lock keywords.
;;
;;
;; Highlight Refontification:
;;
;; Minor mode that visualizes how font-lock refontifies a buffer.
;; This is useful when developing or debugging font-lock keywords,
;; especially for keywords that span multiple lines.
;;
;; The background of the buffer is painted in a rainbow of colors,
;; where each band in the rainbow represent a region of the buffer
;; that has been refontified.  When the buffer is modified, the
;; rainbow is updated.
;;
;;
;; Faceup:
;;
;; Emacs is capable of highlighting buffers based on language-specific
;; `font-lock' rules.  This package makes it possible to perform
;; regression test for packages that provide font-lock rules.
;;
;; The underlying idea is to convert text with highlights ("faces")
;; into a plain text representation using the Faceup markup
;; language.  This language is semi-human readable, for example:
;;
;;     «k:this» is a keyword
;;
;; By comparing the current highlight with a highlight performed with
;; stable versions of a package, it's possible to automatically find
;; problems that otherwise would have been hard to spot.
;;
;; This package is designed to be used in conjunction with Ert, the
;; standard Emacs regression test system.
;;
;; The Faceup markup language is a generic markup language, regression
;; testing is merely one way to use it.
;;
;;
;; Face Explorer:
;;
;; Library and tools for faces and text properties.
;;
;; This library is useful for packages that convert syntax highlighted
;; buffers to other formats.  The functions can be used to determine
;; how a face or a face text property looks, in terms of primitive
;; face attributes (e.g. foreground and background colors).  Two sets
;; of functions are provided, one for existing frames and one for
;; fictitious displays, like 8 color tty.
;;
;; In addition, the following tools are provided:
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-faces' -- list all available faces.  Like
;;   `list-faces-display' but with information on how a face is
;;   defined.  In addition, a sample for the selected frame and for a
;;   fictitious display is shown.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-describe-face' -- Print detailed information on
;;   how a face is defined, and list all underlying definitions.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-describe-face-prop' -- Describe the `face' text
;;   property at the point in terms of primitive face attributes.
;;   Also show how it would look on a fictitious display.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-display-features' -- Show which features a
;;   display supports.  Most graphical displays support all, or most,
;;   features.  However, many tty:s don't support, for example,
;;   strike-through.  Using specially constructed faces, the resulting
;;   buffer will render differently in different displays, e.g. a
;;   graphical frame and a tty connected using `emacsclient -nw'.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-face-prop-examples' -- Show a buffer with an
;;   assortment of `face' text properties.  A sample text is shown in
;;   four variants: Native, a manually maintained reference vector,
;;   the result of `face-explorer-face-prop-attributes' and
;;   `face-explorer-face-prop-attributes-for-fictitious-display'.  Any
;;   package that convert a buffer to another format (like HTML, ANSI,
;;   or LaTeX) could use this buffer to ensure that everything work as
;;   intended.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-list-overlay-examples' -- Show a buffer with a
;;   number of examples of overlays, some are mixed with `face' text
;;   properties.  Any package that convert a buffer to another format
;;   (like HTML, ANSI, or LaTeX) could use this buffer to ensure that
;;   everything work as intended.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-tooltip-mode' -- Minor mode that shows tooltips
;;   containing text properties and overlays at the mouse pointer.
;;
;; - `face-explorer-simulate-display-mode' -- Minor mode for make a
;;   buffer look like it would on a fictitious display.  Using this
;;   you can, for example, see how a theme would look in using dark or
;;   light background, a 8 color tty, or on a grayscale graphical
;;   monitor.
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Regression Suite:
;;
;; A collection of example source files for a large number of
;; programming languages, with ERT tests to ensure that syntax
;; highlighting does not accidentally change.
;;
;; For each source file, font-lock reference files are provided for
;; various Emacs versions.  The reference files contains a plain-text
;; representation of source file with syntax highlighting, using the
;; format "faceup".
;;
;; Of course, the collection source file can be used for other kinds
;; of testing, not limited to font-lock regression testing.
